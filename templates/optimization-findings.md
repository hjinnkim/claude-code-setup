# Optimization Findings

## Optimization Priority
Follow user's priority from CLAUDE.md "Who I Am" section:
- Primary: [Memory efficiency / Compute speed / Code readability]
- Secondary: [Memory efficiency / Compute speed / Code readability]

Always explain trade-offs when suggesting optimizations.

## How to Use
1. Before optimizing, check existing findings for similar patterns
2. After optimizing, record the finding here
3. Include measured impact (not just estimates)
