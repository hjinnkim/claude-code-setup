## When to Reference Each File

| File | Check When | Skip When |
|------|------------|-----------|
| project-structure.md | Need file location, build commands, entry points | Already know the codebase |
| optimization-findings.md | Performance issue, memory problem | Unrelated to performance |
| command-registry.md | Repeated task detected, creating automation | One-time task |
| paper-references.md | Implementing algorithm, need citation | No academic context |
| error-solutions.md | Error occurs, debugging | No errors |
| tech-decisions.md | Architecture question, design choice | Simple code change |

## Entry Counting
- Count entries by `### ` (level 3 header)
- Exclude template/instruction sections
- 50+ entries: suggest cleanup / 100+ entries: suggest compression
